+ Create an API with 4 Endpoints 
    1. Endpoint 1- Make an endpoint that accepts multiple string inputs and outputs a story using those inputs.
    2. Endpoint 2- Make an endpoint that accepts a number input and outputs whether the number is even or odd. Data validation required
    3. Endpoint 3- Make an endpoint that accepts a string or numerical input, and outputs the input in the reverse sequence to how it was entered (ex: "hello" would output to "olleh")
    4. Endpoint 4- Make an endpoint that accepts ONLY a sequence of numbers as the input, and outputs the input in the reverse sequence it was entered in (ex: '1139' would output to '9311')
